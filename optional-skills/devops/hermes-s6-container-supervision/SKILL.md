# Hermes s6-overlay Container Supervision

## When to use this skill

Load this skill when you're working on:
- Adding or removing a static service in the Hermes Docker image (something that should be supervised at every container start, like the dashboard)
- Diagnosing why a per-profile gateway isn't starting, restarting, or surviving `docker restart`
- Understanding why the container's CMD is `/opt/hermes/docker/main-wrapper.sh` and how leading-dash args reach the user's program
- Modifying `cont-init.d` boot scripts (UID remap, volume seeding, profile reconciliation)
- Changing the rendered run-script for per-profile gateways (Phase 4)
- Running the standard **two-container deployment** (a `gateway` container + a `dashboard` container that share the `~/.hermes` volume) and needing the **role gate** so only the gateway runs the per-profile gateways and the `:11435` Claude proxy
- Diagnosing the **bots going dark / `:11435` proxy unstable** — especially `s6-log: fatal: unable to lock /opt/data/logs/claude-proxy/lock: Resource busy` (exit 111) flapping in the gateway's logs
- Writing or fixing the **post-deploy health gate** that probes the proxy (and why it must probe *inside* the container)

If you're just running the Hermes Agent and want to use Docker, see `website/docs/user-guide/docker.md` instead.

## Key files

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `Dockerfile` | s6-overlay install + cont-init.d wiring + `ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/hermes/docker/entrypoint-dispatch.sh"]` |
| `docker/entrypoint-dispatch.sh` | PID-1 dispatcher: exec's `/init` + main-wrapper when the image owns PID 1; on wrapped runtimes (Fly Machines, `docker run --init`) falls back to stage2-hook + main-wrapper directly, restoring the s6 helper PATH first (#38349). |
| `docker/stage2-hook.sh` | The "old entrypoint logic" — UID remap, chown, seed, skills sync. Runs as cont-init.d/01-hermes-setup. |
| `docker/cont-init.d/02-reconcile-profiles` | Calls `hermes_cli.container_boot` on every boot to restore profile gateway slots from the persistent volume. Role-gated: skips the reconciler in the dashboard container. |
| `docker/cont-init.d/03-seed-data-services` | Seeds volume-backed s6 services (the `:11435` Claude proxy) from `$HERMES_HOME/services/` into the tmpfs scandir. Role-gated: seeds nothing in the dashboard container. |
| `docker/hermes-role.sh` | Sourceable helper printing the container role (`gateway`\|`dashboard`). Resolves `$HERMES_ROLE`, else infers from the CMD in `/proc`, defaults to `gateway`. Consulted by 02 + 03. |
| `deploy/claude-proxy/claude_proxy.py` | The `:11435` Claude proxy. Binds **container-local** `127.0.0.1:11435`; serves `GET /health` and `POST /v1/chat/completions`. Run as the volume-backed `claude-proxy` s6 service. |
| `docker/main-wrapper.sh` | The container's CMD. Routes user args, drops to hermes via `s6-setuidgid`, exec's the chosen program. |
| `docker/s6-rc.d/main-hermes/run` | No-op `sleep infinity` — slot exists so the s6-rc user bundle is valid; main hermes runs as the CMD, not as a supervised service. |
| `docker/s6-rc.d/dashboard/run` | Conditional service — `exec sleep infinity` unless `HERMES_DASHBOARD` is truthy. |
| `docker/entrypoint.sh` | Back-compat shim that `exec`s the stage2 hook. External scripts that hard-coded the old entrypoint path still work. |
| `hermes_cli/service_manager.py` | `S6ServiceManager`: `register_profile_gateway`, `unregister_profile_gateway`, `start/stop/restart/is_running`, `list_profile_gateways`. |
| `hermes_cli/container_boot.py` | `reconcile_profile_gateways()` — walks persistent profiles, regenerates s6 slots, emits `container-boot.log`. |
| `hermes_cli/gateway.py::_dispatch_via_service_manager_if_s6` | Intercepts `hermes gateway start/stop/restart` and routes to s6 when running in a container. |

## Why Architecture B (CMD as main program, not s6-supervised)

The original plan (v1–v3) called for main hermes to run as a supervised s6-rc service. Two real s6-overlay v3 mechanics blocked that:

1. **cont-init.d scripts receive no CMD args** — so the stage2 hook can't parse `docker run <image> chat -q "hi"` to set `HERMES_ARGS` for a service `run` script to consume.
2. **`/run/s6/basedir/bin/halt` does NOT propagate the exit code** written to `/run/s6-linux-init-container-results/exitcode`. Containers always exit 143 (SIGTERM) regardless. Confirmed by skarnet (s6 author) in [issue #477](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay/issues/477): _"if you want a container shutdown, you need to either have your CMD exit, or, if you have no CMD, write the container exit code you want then call halt"_.

So we use the s6-overlay-native CMD pattern via the dispatcher: `ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/hermes/docker/entrypoint-dispatch.sh"]`, which under PID 1 exec's `/init /opt/hermes/docker/main-wrapper.sh "$@"`. The wrapper is prepended to user args automatically — so `docker run <image> --version` becomes `/init main-wrapper.sh --version`, and `--version` doesn't get intercepted by /init's POSIX shell. The wrapper drops to hermes via `s6-setuidgid`, then exec's the chosen program. The program's exit code becomes the container exit code, exactly matching the pre-s6 tini contract. When the entrypoint is NOT PID 1 (Fly Machines, `docker run --init`), the dispatcher skips `/init` entirely (it would abort with `can only run as pid 1`), restores the s6 helper PATH, runs stage2-hook.sh, and exec's main-wrapper.sh directly — no supervised services on that path (#38349).

Trade-off: main hermes is unsupervised under s6. That exactly matches its behavior under tini (the pre-s6 image). Dashboard supervision is the only **new** guarantee — and per-profile gateways under `/run/service/` get full supervision.

## Multi-container deployments: the gateway/dashboard role gate

The standard deployment runs **two containers from the same image** (`docker-compose.yml`):

| Container | CMD | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `hermes` (gateway) | `gateway run` | the bots + per-profile gateways + the `:11435` Claude proxy |
| `hermes-dashboard` | `dashboard --host …` | the web UI on `:9119` |

Both mount the **same** `~/.hermes` volume at `/opt/data`, and both run the **same** `/init` + `cont-init.d` hooks. Without a guard, `02-reconcile-profiles` and `03-seed-data-services` would start the gateways **and** the Claude proxy in *both* containers.

**Why that is catastrophic:** the proxy's `s6-log` takes an **exclusive lock** on the shared `/opt/data/logs/claude-proxy/lock`. If both containers seed the proxy, whichever container's `s6-log` wins the lock starves the other — the loser dies with `s6-log: fatal: unable to lock …/claude-proxy/lock: Resource busy` (exit 111) and **flaps forever**. The flapping logger destabilizes the proxy producer (broken stdout pipe → SIGPIPE → restart), the gateway loses its Claude provider, and **the bots go dark** — yet `docker compose up -d` and a naive deploy still report success. This was a real, recurring outage.

**The fix — the role gate (`docker/hermes-role.sh`):**

```
hermes_role() resolves, first match wins:
  1. $HERMES_ROLE if set to gateway|dashboard   (compose sets it explicitly)
  2. else infer from the CMD that s6's rc.init carries in /proc:
        … main-wrapper.sh dashboard …  → dashboard ; anything else → gateway
  3. else default to gateway  (single-container / all-in-one fails SAFE)
```

`02` and `03` source it and **exit early in the dashboard role**. Net invariant:

> **Only the gateway container ever seeds/runs the per-profile gateways and the `:11435` proxy. The dashboard is a read-only viewer.**

Notes:
- The fix lives **entirely in the image**, so it holds regardless of the server-side compose file (the deploy may use a compose that isn't in this repo and that you can't edit).
- The repo compose files set `HERMES_ROLE` explicitly (`gateway` / `dashboard`); the `/proc` inference is the belt-and-suspenders fallback for deployments that don't.
- Default-to-gateway is deliberate: misdetecting dashboard→gateway re-introduces contention, but misdetecting gateway→dashboard would silently run nothing. Fail toward "run the stack."
- Regression-locked by `tests/test_hermes_role.py` (pure POSIX sh + `/proc`, no docker).

## Quick recipes

### Diagnose "bots are dark / :11435 unstable" (proxy log-lock contention)

The signature is the gateway's logger flapping on the shared lock. Read-only checks:

```sh
# Who actually runs claude-proxy? After the role gate, ONLY the gateway.
for c in hermes hermes-dashboard; do
  echo "== $c =="
  docker exec "$c" sh -c 'ls -1 /run/service | grep -E "claude-proxy|gateway-" || echo none'
done
# Gateway: claude-proxy + gateway-* present.  Dashboard: none.

# Proxy + its logger both up in the gateway (not flapping)?
docker exec hermes /command/s6-svstat /run/service/claude-proxy
docker exec hermes /command/s6-svstat /run/service/claude-proxy/log
# Want: both "up (pid …) … seconds".  A flapping "down (exitcode 111) 0 seconds,
# … want up" on the /log service == lock contention.

# Smoking gun in the logs:
docker logs hermes 2>&1 | grep -iE 'resource busy|unable to lock|exitcode 111'

# Map every host s6-log writing to the proxy log dir back to its container —
# more than one container here == the duplicate-proxy bug:
for pid in $(pgrep -f 's6-log.*claude-proxy'); do
  tr '\0' ' ' < /proc/$pid/cmdline; \
  grep -hoE 'docker[-/][0-9a-f]{12,}' /proc/$pid/cgroup | head -1
done
```

Fix = ensure the dashboard container resolves to the dashboard role (set
`HERMES_ROLE=dashboard`, or confirm its CMD starts with `dashboard`). See the
role gate section above. The read-only `.github/workflows/diagnose-contabo.yml`
runs exactly these probes against the live host without recreating anything.

### Check which role a running container resolved to

```sh
docker exec <c> sh -c 'echo "${HERMES_ROLE:-(unset)}"'          # explicit env, if any
docker inspect -f '{{json .Config.Cmd}}' <c>                    # the CMD the role is inferred from
docker exec <c> sh -c 'ls -1 /run/service'                      # gateway has claude-proxy + gateway-*; dashboard does not
```

### Verify s6 is PID 1 in a running container

```sh
docker exec <c> sh -c 'cat /proc/1/comm; readlink /proc/1/exe'
# Expect: s6-svscan or init / /package/admin/s6/.../s6-svscan
```

### Inspect a profile gateway service

```sh
# /command/ isn't on docker-exec PATH — use absolute path
docker exec <c> /command/s6-svstat /run/service/gateway-<name>
# "up (pid …) … seconds"            → running
# "down (exitcode N) … seconds, normally up, want up, …" → s6 wants it up but the process keeps exiting (crash loop)
# "down … normally up, ready …"     → user stopped it
```

### Bring a service up/down manually

```sh
docker exec <c> /command/s6-svc -u /run/service/gateway-<name>   # up
docker exec <c> /command/s6-svc -d /run/service/gateway-<name>   # down
docker exec <c> /command/s6-svc -t /run/service/gateway-<name>   # SIGTERM (restart)
```

### Watch the cont-init reconciler log

```sh
docker exec <c> tail -n 50 /opt/data/logs/container-boot.log
# 2026-05-21T06:18:05+0000 profile=coder prior_state=running action=started
# 2026-05-21T06:18:05+0000 profile=writer prior_state=stopped action=registered
```

### Add a new static service

1. Create `docker/s6-rc.d/<name>/type` with `longrun\n` and `docker/s6-rc.d/<name>/run` (use `#!/command/with-contenv sh` + `# shellcheck shell=sh`).
2. Drop to hermes via `s6-setuidgid hermes` at the top of run (unless you specifically need root).
3. Create empty `docker/s6-rc.d/<name>/dependencies.d/base` so it waits for the base bundle.
4. Create empty `docker/s6-rc.d/user/contents.d/<name>` so it joins the user bundle.
5. The `COPY docker/s6-rc.d/` in the Dockerfile picks it up automatically — no other changes.

### Change the per-profile gateway run command

Edit `S6ServiceManager._render_run_script` in `hermes_cli/service_manager.py`. The function is also called by `hermes_cli/container_boot.py::_register_service` during boot reconciliation, so it's the single source of truth. Update the corresponding assertion in `tests/hermes_cli/test_service_manager.py::test_s6_register_creates_service_dir_and_triggers_scan`.

### Run the docker test harness

```sh
docker build -t hermes-agent-harness:latest .
HERMES_TEST_IMAGE=hermes-agent-harness:latest scripts/run_tests.sh tests/docker/ -v
# Expect 19 passed, 0 xfailed against the s6 image
```

The harness lives in `tests/docker/` and skips when Docker isn't available. The per-test timeout is bumped to 180s (see `tests/docker/conftest.py`).

## Common pitfalls

### "command not found" via `docker exec`

`/command/` (where s6-overlay puts its binaries) is on PATH only for processes spawned by the supervision tree — services, cont-init.d, main-wrapper.sh. `docker exec <c> s6-svstat …` will fail with "command not found"; always use the absolute path `/command/s6-svstat`. The `hermes` binary works because the Dockerfile adds `/opt/hermes/.venv/bin` to the runtime `ENV PATH`.

### Profile directory ownership

The cont-init reconciler runs as hermes (`s6-setuidgid hermes` in `02-reconcile-profiles`). If a profile dir ends up root-owned (e.g. because `docker exec <c> hermes profile create …` ran as root by default), the reconciler can't read SOUL.md and fails with `PermissionError`. Mitigation: `stage2-hook.sh` chowns `$HERMES_HOME/profiles` to hermes on **every** boot, idempotently. Don't remove that block.

### Files written by `docker exec` are root-owned

`docker exec` defaults to root. Either pass `--user hermes` or rely on the stage2 chown sweep next reboot. Don't write files under `$HERMES_HOME/profiles/<name>/` as root manually — the next reconcile pass will sweep them but in-flight operations may hit perm errors.

### Service slot exists but s6-svstat says "s6-supervise not running"

The service directory is on tmpfs and was wiped on container restart. Either the cont-init reconciler hasn't run yet (give it a moment after `docker restart`) or it failed. Check `docker logs <c> | grep '02-reconcile'`.

### Gateway starts then immediately exits (`down (exitcode 1)` in svstat)

Most likely the profile has no model or auth configured. The service slot is correct — the gateway itself is unconfigured. Run `hermes -p <profile> setup` first. The s6 supervisor will keep restarting it; that's the desired behavior (when you fix the config, the next attempt succeeds and stays up).

### Reconciler skipped a profile

The reconciler keys on the **presence of `SOUL.md`** as the "real profile" marker. `hermes profile create` always seeds it. If a profile dir is missing SOUL.md (stray directory, partial restore, backup-in-progress), the reconciler skips it intentionally. Add a `SOUL.md` (even empty) to opt back in.

### Health-probing :11435 from the host returns "connection refused" even though the proxy is up

The proxy binds **container-local** `127.0.0.1:11435` (see `claude_proxy.py`). On this deployment the containers run on a **bridge** network (the dashboard publishes `127.0.0.1:9119->9119`, which `network_mode: host` cannot do), so a probe from the **host** loopback can never reach the container's `:11435` — the bots reach it fine because they live *inside* the gateway container. Always probe on the path the bots use:

```sh
docker exec hermes sh -c 'curl -fsS -m5 http://127.0.0.1:11435/health'
# {"status": "ok", …, "breaker": {"open": false, …}}
```

A host-side `curl 127.0.0.1:11435` in a deploy gate is a **false negative** and will red a healthy deploy (this happened — the proxy logged "Proxy ready" while the host probe failed for 10 min). The `deploy-contabo.yml` health gate runs the probe via `docker exec` for exactly this reason.

### Two containers fighting over the proxy log lock

If you see `s6-log: … unable to lock …/claude-proxy/lock: Resource busy` (exit 111) flapping, a second container (almost always `hermes-dashboard`) is seeding/running the proxy against the shared `~/.hermes` volume. This is the role-gate failure mode — see "Multi-container deployments" above. Do **not** "fix" it by moving the lock or giving each container its own logs dir; the correct invariant is that only the gateway runs the proxy.

### "Help, the container exits 143!"

Check whether something is invoking `s6-svscanctl -t` or `/run/s6/basedir/bin/halt` — both cause /init to begin stage 3 shutdown but return 143 (SIGTERM) rather than the desired exit code. This was the Phase 2 architecture pivot from A to B. For container shutdown with a real exit code, you must let the CMD (main-wrapper.sh) exit normally; do **not** try to control exit from a finish script.
